# Threats to Validity

**Construct:** Browser "gaze-confirm" (hover+spacebar) is a proxy for XR gaze+pinch. Mitigation: frame as gaze-directed pointing; plan HMD replication.

**Internal:** Carryover despite Williams counterbalancing. Mitigation: include block_number and test block-order effects post hoc.

**External:** Browser latency differs from HMD. Mitigation: benchmark to ISO mouse/controller norms; treat absolute TP cautiously.

**Statistical conclusion:** Underpowered TOST. Mitigation: CI-based equivalence as primary; report sensitivity bounds (±3/±5/±7.5%).
