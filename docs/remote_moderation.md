# Remote Moderation Checklist (Zoom)

- Pre-email: Chrome required, full-screen, 100% zoom; disable auto-brightness/True Tone/Night Shift.
- Join Zoom with **audio only** on the test machine (or from a second device) if attempting optional camera check.
- At start: run **System Check**; verify pass.
- Read **instructions.md**; ensure participant passes **comprehension** gate on /intro.
- Monitor completion; pause between blocks for questions.
- If the browser requests camera and Zoom is using it, continue without camera (study is not blocked).
