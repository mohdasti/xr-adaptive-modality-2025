## Overview

We respect your privacy. This notice explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you participate in our research study.

## Data We Collect

### What We Collect

When you use this application, we collect:

**Performance Data:**
- Reaction times (how long it takes you to complete tasks)
- Click/tap positions (where you click on screen)
- Accuracy (whether you completed tasks correctly)
- Task completion times

**Settings Data:**
- Input method preferences (hand vs. gaze)
- UI mode selections
- Contextual factor settings (pressure, aging)

**Workload Ratings:**
- Your subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX scores)
- Ratings of mental demand and effort

**System Information:**
- Browser type and version
- Screen resolution
- Device pixel ratio (DPI)

**Optional Physiological Data:**
- Estimated cognitive load (if camera is enabled)
- This is a scalar value only - no video is stored

### What We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect:

- ❌ Your name, email, or any personally identifying information
- ❌ IP addresses (if present, they are immediately removed)
- ❌ User agent strings (browser fingerprinting removed)
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Any information outside the application
- ❌ Video or photographic images (even if camera is used)

## How Your Data is Used

### Research Purposes

Your data is used to:

- Analyze how different input methods (hand vs. gaze) affect performance
- Evaluate adaptive UI interventions
- Study the relationship between cognitive load and performance
- Improve extended reality (XR) interface design

### Data Processing

- **Participant IDs**: Immediately hashed using SHA256 encryption
- **IP Addresses**: Stripped before any data is stored
- **User Agents**: Removed from all stored data
- **Anonymization**: All data is anonymized before analysis

### Data Sharing

- Individual data is never shared
- Only aggregate statistics will be published
- Data may be shared with research collaborators (anonymized)
- Publication uses group-level statistics only

## Camera Usage (Optional)

### Why Camera?

The application can use your webcam to estimate cognitive load via pupil diameter analysis. This is **completely optional**.

### What Camera Does

- **Samples luminance** (brightness) from your face region
- **Calculates a z-score** (standardized measure of cognitive load)
- **No video stored** - only a scalar value is logged

### What Camera Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does NOT store video frames
- ❌ Does NOT take photographs
- ❌ Does NOT track your face
- ❌ Does NOT transmit images anywhere
- ❌ Does NOT use facial recognition

### Your Control

- You can **deny camera permission** without penalty
- You can **revoke camera permission** at any time
- Camera is **off by default** - you must explicitly enable it
- You can **disable camera** mid-study without losing progress

### Privacy Protection

- All camera processing happens **locally in your browser**
- Only a single number (z-score) is logged to CSV
- No video data leaves your computer
- Camera feature disabled by default

## Data Storage and Retention

### Storage Location

- Data is stored **locally** on your computer during the study
- If you submit data, it is transferred via secure connection
- Data is stored on secure, encrypted servers

### Retention Period

- **≤90 days**: Data retained for analysis
- **After 90 days**: All raw data files permanently deleted
- **Permanent retention**: Only anonymized, aggregated statistics
- No personal data is retained beyond the study period

### Your Access

- You can download your data at any time (Download CSV button)
- You can request data deletion (within 90 days)
- You can verify data accuracy

## Data Security

### Security Measures

- **Encryption**: All transfers use HTTPS
- **Hashing**: Participant IDs encrypted with SHA256
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed before storage
- **Access Control**: Only authorized researchers have access
- **Secure Storage**: Data stored on encrypted servers

### What We Protect

- Your performance data is anonymized
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- Identifiers are hashed before storage
- IP addresses and fingerprints are stripped

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: Download your data anytime
- **Delete**: Request data deletion (within retention period)
- **Opt-out**: Decline any feature (camera, data collection)
- **Withdraw**: Exit the study at any time without penalty
- **Transparency**: Understand what data is collected

### How to Exercise Your Rights

- **Download Data**: Use "Download CSV" button in the app
- **Request Deletion**: Email the researchers (contact info below)
- **Opt-out**: Close the application or decline permissions
- **Questions**: Contact us using information below

## Third-Party Services

### No Tracking

We do not use:
- ❌ Google Analytics
- ❌ Facebook Pixel
- ❌ Advertising trackers
- ❌ Third-party analytics
- ❌ Social media plugins

### Optional APIs

The application may use browser APIs for:
- **getUserMedia**: Camera access (optional)
- **localStorage**: Save settings locally (optional)

These are standard browser features and require your explicit permission.

## International Data Transfers

- Data is processed in the country where our servers are located
- Standard security measures apply regardless of location
- Data is not transferred to third countries

## Changes to This Notice

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. If we make significant changes:

- You will be notified in the application
- Effective date will be updated
- Continued use implies acceptance

**Address**: [Fill in]

## Plain English Summary

We collect performance data (reaction times, accuracy) and settings to study how people use different input methods. No personal information (name, email, IP) is collected. Your participant ID is encrypted. Camera (optional) is used to estimate cognitive load - no video is stored, only a number. Data is kept ≤90 days for analysis, then deleted. You control your camera and can download/delete your data anytime.

## Consent

By using this application, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this privacy notice and agree to the data collection and usage described above.
