# Participant Information and Consent Form

**Research Title**: Adaptive Modality Systems in Extended Reality: A Fitts's Law Investigation

**Principal Investigator**: [Fill in Name]

**Contact Information**: [Fill in Email/Phone]

**Date**: [Fill in Date]

## Purpose

We are conducting a research study to understand how people interact with different input methods (hand pointing vs. eye gaze) in extended reality (XR) environments. Specifically, we are investigating whether adaptive user interface changes can improve performance and reduce mental workload when using different interaction modalities.

This study has been approved by [Institution Name Ethics Committee].

## What You Will Be Asked to Do

If you agree to participate, you will:

1. **Complete a Fitts's Law Target Selection Task**
   - Click on targets as quickly and accurately as possible
   - Task will be completed in 3-5 blocks (~10 minutes total)
   - Each block has 15-30 trials (varies by condition)

2. **Use Two Different Input Methods**
   - Hand-like (move cursor + click)
   - Gaze-like (look + confirm with Space key)
   - Each input method will be explained before use

3. **Complete Workload Assessments**
   - After each block, rate your workload using sliders (0-100)
   - Takes ~30 seconds per assessment

4. **Optional Camera Permission**
   - You may be asked to enable webcam access for cognitive load estimation
   - This is **completely optional** - you can decline without penalty
   - Camera is used only to estimate pupil diameter (a proxy for cognitive load)
   - No video frames are stored or transmitted - only a scalar value is recorded
   - You can disable camera at any time

**Total Duration**: Approximately 30-45 minutes

## Time Commitment

- **Study Duration**: 30-45 minutes (including instructions)
- **Number of Sessions**: 1 session
- **Time Breakdown**:
  - Instructions and setup: 5-10 minutes
  - Practice trials: 5 minutes
  - Experimental trials: 15-20 minutes
  - Break between blocks: 2 minutes (optional)
  - Workload assessments: 2-3 minutes
  - Debrief: 2-3 minutes

## Anonymity and Confidentiality

### Data Anonymization

- Your participant ID (e.g., P001) will be **hashed** using SHA256 encryption before any data is stored
- All personally identifiable information will be removed
- Only aggregate statistics will be reported in publications

### Data Collected

**We collect:**
- Reaction times (milliseconds)
- Click/tap positions (pixel coordinates)
- Correct/incorrect responses
- Workload ratings (NASA-TLX scores)
- Browser and device information

**We do NOT collect:**
- Your name, email, or other personal information
- IP addresses (if present, they are stripped)
- User agent strings (stripped from data)
- Video frames (even if camera is enabled)

### Camera Data (Optional)

If you enable camera access:
- Camera is used to estimate pupil diameter via luminance sampling
- **No video frames are stored or transmitted**
- Only a scalar z-score value (cognitive load proxy) is logged
- All processing occurs locally in your browser
- You can revoke camera permission at any time

### Data Retention

- **Retention Period**: Data will be retained for no more than **90 days** after study completion
- After analysis is complete, all raw data files will be permanently deleted
- Only anonymized, aggregated results will be retained for publication purposes

### Data Storage

- All data is stored **locally** on your computer during the study
- Data is exported as CSV files
- If you choose to submit data, it will be transferred via secure connection
- Data will be stored on secure, encrypted servers

### Access to Your Data

- You can download your data at any time during the study (Download CSV button)
- You have the right to withdraw your data until the retention period ends
- Contact the researcher to request data deletion

## Risks and Benefits

### Potential Risks

- **Minimal**: This study involves normal computer use
- **Fatigue**: Slight eye or hand fatigue possible (take breaks as needed)
- **Privacy**: Minimal risk - no personal data collected
- **Camera**: Optional feature; can be disabled at any time

### Potential Benefits

- **Contribution to Science**: Help improve XR interface design
- **Financial Incentive**: [Fill in if applicable]
- **Course Credit**: [Fill in if applicable]
- **Learning**: Understand how input methods affect performance

## Voluntary Participation

## Right to Withdraw

You have the right to:
- Withdraw from the study at any time
- Skip any questions or tasks
- Refuse camera permission (completely optional)
- Request your data be deleted (within 90 days)
