# Methods Detail

**Block order:** Four blocks following Williams counterbalancing (HaS → GaA → GaS → HaA, GaS → HaA → HaS → GaA, HaA → GaS → GaA → HaS, GaA → HaS → HaA → GaS). Participants complete all four blocks; starting block assigned to balance first-order carryover. Each block includes 40 trials (10 per ID), yielding ~160 trials per participant.

**Trial structure:** (1) Block intro screen confirms modality and UI mode; (2) Countdown (3 s) and fixation; (3) Fitts target sequence with randomized amplitudes/widths; (4) Feedback banner on hit/error with RT display; (5) 1.5 s inter-trial interval; (6) Adaptive policy status badge updates asynchronously; (7) Block summary with accuracy, MT, throughput.

**TLX timing:** Raw NASA-TLX administered after every block via in-app modal. Participants complete global, mental, effort, and frustration ratings before proceeding. Modal enforces completion; responses logged with block number and timestamp.

**Display requirements:** Fullscreen enforced (`F11`/`⌃⌘F` prompt); min resolution 1280×720; browser zoom locked to 100% (poll every block); disable system night mode prompts; recommend external mouse or trackpad with palm rejection; ambient lighting guidance provided in setup email.

**Williams counterbalancing table:**

| Sequence | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| W1 | HaS | GaA | GaS | HaA |
| W2 | GaS | HaA | HaS | GaA |
| W3 | HaA | GaS | GaA | HaS |
| W4 | GaA | HaS | HaA | GaS |
