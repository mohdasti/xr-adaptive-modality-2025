# Hypotheses (Lean 2×2)

**H1 (Modality—speed & errors).** Controlling for difficulty and order, **hand** yields **faster movement time** and **higher throughput** than **gaze-confirm**; hand may incur **slightly higher error** on hard targets.

**H2 (Adaptation—safety without slowdown).** **Adaptive UI** produces a **≥15% relative error reduction** vs **Static** while **not exceeding a 5% RT penalty** (TOST equivalence on log-RT with ±5% bounds).

**H3 (Modality × Adaptation).** **Width-inflate** (hand) yields **larger error reduction** than declutter; **declutter** (gaze) yields **greater RT improvement** than width-inflate. Throughput improves in both.

**H4 (Fitts scaling).** With **effective width (We)** and **effective ID (IDe)**, **Fitts's Law holds** (R² ≥ .80), and **gaze** shows a **steeper slope** (greater time cost per bit) than **hand**.

**H5 (Workload).** **Adaptive UI** reduces **NASA-TLX total** by **≥10–15%**; the larger TLX drop occurs in the modality that shows the larger performance gain in H3.
