**Adaptive Modality Systems for Extended Reality: A Fitts's Law Investigation**

A research platform for studying adaptive user interface interventions in dual-modality XR environments (hand vs. gaze). Features Fitts's Law target selection, policy-driven adaptation, contextual factors (pressure, aging), and comprehensive data logging.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This platform enables researchers to:
- Study hand vs. gaze interaction patterns using Fitts's Law
- Investigate adaptive UI interventions based on performance and context
- Evaluate cognitive load using NASA-TLX
- Generate comprehensive CSV datasets for statistical analysis

Key features include:
- **Dual-modality support**: Hand-like (click) and gaze-like (dwell + Space key) interactions
- **Adaptive policies**: Rule-based UI adaptation (declutter, inflate width) based on performance triggers
- **Contextual factors**: Time pressure countdown and aging proxy (visual impairment simulation)
- **Robust logging**: 23-column CSV schema with participant tracking, TLX scores, and metadata
- **Analysis ready**: Python ops tools (anonymization, validation) and R/Python analysis skeletons

## Quick Start

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Features

### Three-Pane Control Panel

- **Task Control**: Manage trials, trigger events, change policies, and run Fitts tasks
- **System HUD**: Real-time statistics and system status monitoring
- **Event Logger**: Comprehensive event logging with last 20 events displayed

### Fitts's Law Task

- Standard target selection paradigm (ISO 9241-9)
- Configurable difficulty levels (ID: 1.7 - 5.6 bits)
- Reaction time measurement
- Block-based trial management

### Adaptive Modality System

- **Hand-like**: Direct pointing (move + click)
- **Gaze-like**: Hover-based selection with configurable confirmation
  - Dwell-based (350ms, 500ms auto-confirm)
  - Confirmation-based (Space key to confirm)
- Real-time modality switching
- Error detection (miss, timeout, slip)

### Policy-Based Adaptation Engine

- Rule-based adaptation responding to performance
- **Triggers**: RT percentile (p75), error burst detection
- **Actions**:
  - Declutter (gaze): Hide non-critical UI elements
  - Inflate width (hand): Increase target size by 25%
- Hysteresis mechanism (5-trial threshold)
- Configurable via `/policy/policy.default.json`

### Global Event Bus

Lightweight pub/sub system for inter-component communication:
- `trial:start`, `trial:end`, `trial:error`, `policy:change` events
- Type-safe event payloads
- Easy subscription/unsubscription
